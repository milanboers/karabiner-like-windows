## My Karabiner Elements Setup

Makes macOS keyboard shortcuts more like Windows and Linux.

## Changes vs. default PC mode
- Excluded Jetbrains (IntelliJ, Webstorm, PyCharm) from most rules so keybindings can be set to Windows in app
- Alt-Tab rule removed. I use [HyperSwitch](https://bahoom.com/hyperswitch).
- iTerm not excluded from copy/paste/cut rules
